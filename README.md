# ceasar-cipher

## A program that uses simple encryption on strings.

It changes each letter to another letter a specified number of characters up or down the alphabet.
This number and the shift direction is specified based on the key provided.

Whitespace and other non English characters are untouched and the case of the letters are maintained.

So a key of '3' means shift each letter 3 letters forward (to the right), while a key of '-3' means shift 3 letters backwards (to the left).
